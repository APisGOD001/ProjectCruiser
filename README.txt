# ProjectCruiser
This is the project of a car "game" done as a project work with the collaboration of 4 people.
This program was written completely in C programming language using libraries of SDL2, SDL2_Image and SDL2_TTF(These libraries are protected by licences so visit their website http://www.libsdl.org/ for more info about them.
The main title image was searched on Google and was downloaded from : https://www.pexels.com/search/car/.
The other images used are drawn ourself using Paint.net which was downloaded from : http://www.getpaint.net/index.html
Fonts were downloaded from: http://www.dafont.com/ and some fonts were renamed(just the main name) to save time.
To compile this file just load the main.c file and build it, copy all the .dll files to the folder containing the executable file included to run the file. Additionally you will have to download the libgcc-s-dw2-1.dll file as well.
PS: This isn't (by any means) a completed product, it still has many memory issues and was mainly posted to learn gitHub :p
