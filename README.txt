The main title image was searched on Google and was downloaded from : https://www.pexels.com/search/car/.
The other images used are drawn ourself using Paint.net which was downloaded from : http://www.getpaint.net/index.html
Fonts were downloaded from: http://www.dafont.com/ and some fonts were renamed(just the main name) to save time.
